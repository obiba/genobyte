	Defines a skeleton for a genotyping store, to hold genotyping data per sample and assay. This store
	is composed of two bitwise stores which are kept in sync by transposing values from one store to the other.
	The sample store will hold fields for each assay in the assay store, and vice versa. This allows to compute
	statistics efficiently per sample and per assay.
