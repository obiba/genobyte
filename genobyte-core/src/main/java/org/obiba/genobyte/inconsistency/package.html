A set of classes to compute genotype inconsistencies: reproducibility and mendelian errors.
<p/>
<h3>Reproducibility errors</h3>
<b>Description:</b> two genotypes that should be identical but are not. For example, when genotyping
the same sample on the same set of markers will generally produce a certain amount of errors.
<p/>
To compute reproducibility errors, it is necessary to provide which records are comparable, this
is done by implementing the {@link org.obiba.bitwise.genotyping.inconsistency.ComparableRecordProvider} interface.
Using the <tt>ComparableRecordProvider</tt> instance, the {@link
org.obiba.bitwise.genotyping.inconsistency.ReproducibilityErrorCalculator}
is capable of identifying reproducibility errors. For each executed comparision that has identified at least one error,
an instance of {@link org.obiba.bitwise.genotyping.inconsistency.ReproducibilityErrors}
is created which holds all identified errors. The instance of <tt>ReproducibilityErrors</tt> is then fed to an instance
of {@link org.obiba.bitwise.genotyping.inconsistency.ReproducibilityErrorCountingStrategy}
which may handle the errors as necessary.
<p/>
<h3>Mendelian errors</h3>
<b>Description:</b> based on parental relationships (mother-child, father-child) a mendelian error is a combination of
genotypes that is impossible
based on what the child may inherit from its parents. For example, a child may not have the opposite homozygote genotype
(AA vs. BB) than either of its parents.
<p/>
To compute mendelian errors, it is necessary to provide which records are related (mother, father, child relationships).
This is done by implementing the
{@link org.obiba.bitwise.genotyping.inconsistency.MendelianRecordTrioProvider} interface. Using the <tt>MendelianRecordTrioProvider</tt>
instance,
the {@link org.obiba.bitwise.genotyping.inconsistency.MendelianErrorCalculator} is capable of identifying mendelian
errors. For each executed comparision that
has identified at least one error, an instance of {@link org.obiba.bitwise.genotyping.inconsistency.MendelianErrors} is
created which holds all identified
errors. The instance of <tt>MendelianErrors</tt> is then fed to an instance of {@link
org.obiba.bitwise.genotyping.inconsistency.MendelianErrorCountingStrategy}
which may handle the errors as necessary.
